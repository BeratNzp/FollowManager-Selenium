# FollowManager BOT
This project coded with Python's Selenium framework. The project can send bot to instagram, and get what you want attribiutes,texts and values on that site.

### How to install:
``virtualenv mypython``  
``source venv/bin/activate``  
``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``  

### How it works:
This bot asks for your username and password for your instagram account. However, this does not save your information.
It then creates an object from your information and opens the Chrome Web Browser's Test Driver in the "--headless" parameter.


**So in order to run this project;
You should download the version compatible with your browser version from this address and extract the "chromedriver" file to the main directory of the project.**
